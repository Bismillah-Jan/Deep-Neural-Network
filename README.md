# Deep Neural Network from scratch

## Repository contains Four files
1. A Deep Neural Network implementation using `TenosrFlow`. The network is then trained on the MNIST dataset.
2. A Neural Network implemenation using Keras and is trained for `XoR` function.
3. Perceptron implementation from scratch using `sklearn`
4. ADALINE (Adaptive Linear Neuron) implementation from scratch. ADALINE is an early neural network model, often considered a building block in the history of deep neural networks (DNNs).

### How to RUN
* Download the your desired files and run with anaconda 2.7 or above
